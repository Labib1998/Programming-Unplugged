Draw an ovel that is rotated 90 degrees at the centre of the page.

Draw a single dot in the centre of the ovel.

About a centemeter away from the dot on the left and right sides draw a small line. 
The small lines must be drawn from left to right (or right to left, it's the line direction that matters) im going to cheat and say these represent eyes
.
Below the dot, about a centemeter away from the dot, draw a line that expands below one eye to the other. this represents the mouth.

draw a curve below the mouth line that starts from the left end of the mouth line to the right end. 

There's more but it'll take too long to explain so I'll spare you the details.
